## The Project 
-------------
Pratos is a _smart_ personal assistant that is truly personnal. Indeed you can _customize_ everything and every single byte of data belongs to you. The aim of Pratos is to be accessible from every single device and to help you as much as it can.

## The Story behind Pratos 
-------------
Indeed at the beginning, the idea was to allow everyone to control their house with HomeKit on non-Apple Device or without having an Apple TV. Today Pratos perfectly fullfilled this goal. But why stopping here ? 
I decided to build Pratos as a _personal assistant_.

## How is Pratos personal ?
-----------
Firstly Pratos is personal since it __will be__ fully _customizable_ ( from its name to its skin). Furthermore Pratos is personnal because of the upcoming __Prat'store__. An online store where you'll be able to download _plugins_ that match your wills (Firewall, Cloud...). Today, a few plugins are ready but you won't be able to download them.

## Is Pratos ready ?
-----------
__Not at all__. I have been working on this project _for a year_ now (its former name was _Prometheus_ and was built in _PHP_) but it's far from being finished. In the Github Project part you'll be able to have a look at all the upcoming updates and feel free to require some others. 

## Can I help ?
------------
__Of course!__ Since I am a student, I don't have a lot of time to work on Pratos and __help would be greatly appreciated__. However you should __contact me__ before trying installing Pratos yourself since it's not ready for publication at all.

Thanks.
