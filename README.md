The Project 
-------------
Pratos is a smart personal assistant that is truly personnal. Indeed you can customize everything and every single byte of data belongs to you. The aim of Pratos is to be accessible from every single device. 

The Story behind Pratos 
-------------
Indeed at the beginning, the idea was to allow everyone to control their house with HomeKit on non-Apple Device or without having an Apple TV. Today Pratos perfectly fullfilled this goal. But why stopping here ? 
I decided to build Pratos as a personal assistant.

How is Pratos personal ?
-----------
Firstly Pratos is personal since it will be fully customizable ( from its name to its skin). Furthermore Pratos is personnal because of the upcoming Prat'store. An online store where you'll be able to download plugins that match your wills (Firewall, Cloud...).

Is Pratos ready ?
-----------
Not at all. I have been working on this project for a year now (its former name was Prometheus and was built in PHP) but it's far from being finished. In the Github Project part you'll be able to have a look at all the upcoming updates and feel free to require some others. 

Can I help ?
------------
Of course! Since I am a student, I don't have a lot of time to work on Pratos and help would be greatly appreciated. However you should contact me before trying installing Pratos yourself since it's not ready for publication at all.
