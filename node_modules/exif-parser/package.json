  "readme": "exif-parser\n========\nexif-parser is a parser for image metadata in the exif format, the most popular metadata format for jpeg and tiff images. It is written in pure javascript and has no external dependencies. It can also get the size of jpeg images and the size of the jpeg thumbnail embedded in the exif data. It can also extract the embedded thumbnail image.\n\n### Installing\n\n    npm install exif-parser\n\nYou can also build a browser bundle to include it with a `<script>` tag in a HTML document, like this:\n\n\tgit clone git@github.com:bwindels/exif-parser.git\n\tcd exif-parser/\n\tmake build-browser-bundle\n\nBuilt versions of the bundles are also available in the [exif-parser-browser-bundles repo](https://github.com/bwindels/exif-parser-browser-bundles).\n\nThis will generate a `dist/exif-parser-(version).js` and `dist/exif-parser-(version)-min.js` file. These bundles expose the parser on the `ExifParser` global variable, which you would use like this:\n\n\tvar parser = window.ExifParser.create(arrayBuffer);\n\n### Creating a parser\nTo start parsing exif data, create a new parser like below. Note that the buffer you pass does not have to be the buffer for the full jpeg file. The exif section of a jpeg file has a maximum size of 65535 bytes and the section seems to always occur within the first 100 bytes of the file. So it is safe to only fetch the first 65635 bytes of a jpeg file and pass those to the parser.\n\nThe buffer you pass to create can be a node buffer or a DOM ArrayBuffer.\n\n```\nvar parser = require('exif-parser').create(buffer);\nvar result = parser.parse();\n```\n\n### Setting the flags\n\nBefore calling parse, you can set a number of flags on the parser, telling it how to behave while parsing.\n\nAdd fields in the binary format to result. Since these fields are mostly used for internal fields like Padding, you generally are not interested in these. If enabled, values for these fields will be a Buffer object in node or an ArrayBuffer in DOM environments (browsers).\n\n    parser.enableBinaryFields([boolean]), default false;\n\nEXIF tags are organized into different sections, and to tell you the offset to other sections, EXIF uses certain tags. These tags don't tell you anything about the image, but are more for parsers to find out about all tags. Hence, these \"pointer\" fields are not included in the result tags field by default. Change this flag to include them nonetheless.\n\n    parser.enablePointers([boolean]), default false;\n\nResolve tags to their textual name, making result.tags a dictonary object instead of an array with the tag objects with no textual tag name.\n\n    parser.enableTagNames([boolean]), default true;\n\nRead the image size while parsing.\n\n    parser.enableImageSize([boolean]), default true;\n\nRead the EXIF tags. Could be useful to disable if you only want to read the image size.\n\n    parser.enableReturnTags([boolean]), default true;\n\nEXIF values can be represented in a number of formats (fractions, degrees, arrays, ...) with different precision.\nEnabling this tries to cast values as much as possible to the appropriate javascript types like number, Date.\n\n    parser.enableSimpleValues([boolean]), default true;\n\n### working with the result\n\n#### Getting the tags\nthe tags that were found while parsing are stored in ```result.tags``` unless you set ```parser.enableReturnTags(false)```. If ```parser.enableTagNames``` is set to true, ```result.tags``` will be an object with the key being the tag name and the value being the tag value. If ```parser.enableTagNames``` is set to false, ```result.tags``` will be an array of objects containing section, type and value properties.\n\n#### Getting the image size\nIf ```parser.enableImageSize``` is set to true, ```result.getImageSize()``` will give you the image size as an object with width and height properties.\n\n#### Getting the thumbnail\n\nYou can check if there is a thumbnail present in the exif data with ```result.hasThumbnail()```. Exif supports thumbnails is jpeg and tiff format, though most are in jpeg format. You can check if there is a thumbnail present in a give format by passing the mime type: ```result.hasThumbnail(\"image/jpeg\")```.\n\nYou can also get the image size of the thumbnail as an object with width and height properties: ```result.getThumbnailSize()```.\n\nTo get the node buffer or arraybuffer containing just the thumbnail, call ```result.getThumbnailBuffer()```\n\n# Running the unit tests\n\nInstall `nodeunit` globally from npm if you haven't done so already.\nYou can run the tests with `nodeunit test/test-*.js`.\n\n# Contributions\n\nI welcome external contributions through pull requests. If you do so, please don't use regular expressions. I don't like them, and don't want to maintain a project where they are used. Also, when fixing a bug please provide a regression unit test if it makes sense.\n",
